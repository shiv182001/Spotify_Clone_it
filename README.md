# Spotify-Clone

The goal of this project was to create a rudimentary Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is to demonstrate my knowledge in front-end web development.It is a responsive and easy-to-use web application that allows users to listen to music.I designed and styled the interface with HTML and CSS, and I utilized JavaScript to manage user input and interaction, such as basic playback controls (play, pause, and next).I also obtained knowledge with version control systems like Git and GitHub.
